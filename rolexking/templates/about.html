The game of Rummy isn't a game entirely of probability just like the ‘three-card’ game mentioned within the Madras case to that we tend to were referred. The ‘three card’ game which fits underneath completely different names like ‘flush’, ‘brag’ etc. may be a game of pure probability. Rummy, on the opposite hand, needs an exact quantity of talent as a result of the autumn of the cards needs to be memorized and also the build up of Rummy needs appreciable talent in holding and discarding cards. We cannot, therefore, say that the sport of Rummy may be a game of entire probability. it's primarily and predominantly a game of talent.
